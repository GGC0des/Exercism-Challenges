# Exercism Java Track ☕️

Exercism's Java track offers a total of 148 coding challenges to master Java fluency.
Once the test of a coding challenge is passed and submitted the next concept & exercises are unlocked. 
See [Exercism Java Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/java) for more info.

Find my coding solutions to different exercises here on [Github](https://github.com/GGC0des/Exercism-Java/tree/main/java) or [my Exercism profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/GGC0des). 

## Concepts covered by coding challenges

Currently solved challenges address:

* Java Basics
 - String Methods to format log messages
 - Implemented non-void methods with and without parameters
* Primitive Data Types
* Conditional Logic
  -  if-else statements for different production rates based on changing variables, handling errors with System.err.println, turnication of double to int value
* Booleans
 - Implemented boolean operators to calculate boolean value depending on multipe arguments
* Arrays
* For Loop, For-Each Loop
* Mutability vs. Immutablity
 - Return a clone to prevent external modification of the internal array
* Chars
 - Implemented camelCase conversion, leetspeak conversion, alternative Stringbuilder solution through concatenation
* Generic Types
* Lists
* Ternary Operators
 - Second iteration to return ternary operational value in return statement instead of storing it in a variable first
* Classes & Constructors
  - Implemented private vs. public fields, constructor, getter & setter methods, conditional logic to update instance fields depending on its value and a limiter
  - Refactored code in second iteration to use format specifiers instead of concatenating the String in the return statement
  - Refactored code in secod iteration of NeedForSpeed challenge to use public methods and getter methods instead of instance fields (now private) to impelement canFinishRace() method in RaceTrack class 
* Inheritance
  - Override superclass methods for its subclasses
